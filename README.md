# Face-mask-detector
This project is based on OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras. 

# Instructions to run the code:
The jupyter notebook training_model.ipynb will take almost hour and a half to run. So, it is recommended that only detecting_masks.ipynb should be executed to test the code. However, if the first file is executed, the best model out of the 20 models created need to be selected (on the basis of minimum validation loss and maximum accuracy). This new model needs to be stored in the model varaible (line 6 of detecting_masks.ipynb).
